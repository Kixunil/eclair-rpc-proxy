extended-description = """
This is a proxy made specifically for `eclair` to allow finer-grained control of permissions. It enables you to specify several users and for each user the list of RPC calls he's allowed to make.

This is useful because `eclair` allows every application with password to make possibly harmful calls like spending all your money. If you have several applications, you can provide the less trusted ones a different password and permissions than the others using this project.

Especially, you can allow certain applications, like BTCPayServer to create invoices, but not spend the money."""
